# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
## Overview of the loan prediction risk analysis:
### The purpose of this project is the use the features in the AlphbetSoupCharity dataset to help Beks create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.  This data set contains 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization, such as the following:

#### A. Identification columns
#### B. Alphabet Soup application type
#### C. Affiliated sector of industry
#### D. Government organization classification
#### E. Use case for funding
#### F. Organization type
#### G. Active status
#### H. Income classification
#### I. Special consideration for application
#### J. Funding amount requested
#### K. Was the money used effectively 

## Results:
### Data Preprocessing
#### 1. The variable that was considered the target was whether the money was used effectively and the organization was successful.  
#### 2. All other variables were considered features except the application name and EIN number.  
#### 3. The two variables that were removed were the EIN and Name of the organization.  
### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
#### 1. How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
#### 2. Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
#### 3. What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?

## Summary:
